# The Laws of Simplicity

Simplicity = Sanity

## Ten Laws

- **REDUCE** The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction
- **ORGANIZE** Organization makes a system of many appear fewer
- **TIME** Savings in time feel like simplicity
- **LEARN** Knowledge makes everything simpler
- **DIFFERENCES** Simplicity and complexity need each other
- **CONTEXT** What lies in the periphery of Simplicity is definitely not peripheral
- **EMOTION** More emotions are better than less
- **TRUST** In simplicity we trust
- **FAILURE** Some things can never be made simple
- **THE ONE** Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful

## Three Keys
- **AWAY** More appears like less by simply moving it far, far away
- **OPEN** Openness simplifies complexity
- **POWER** Use less gain more
