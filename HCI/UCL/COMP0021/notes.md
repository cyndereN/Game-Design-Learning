# Interaction Design

## W1 Intro to ID

### 1.1.1 What is ID?

Preece, Rogers & Sharp (2019) "Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives."

Winograd (1997) "Designing spaces for human communication and interaction."

### 1.1.2 What is interaction?

stimulus -> response

### 1.1.3 Good Design v.s. Poor Design

Usable (Usability):
- Easy to Learn
- Effective to use
- Enjoyable user experience

### 1.1.4 ID & HCI

HCI is subset of ID

### 1.1.5 User experience (UX)
Preece, Rogers & Sharp (2019) "How people feel about a product and their pleaseure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it"

4 threds:
- Sensual
- Emotional
- Compositional
- Spatio-temporal

### 1.1.6 ID Process

- Discover Requirements
- Designing Alternatives(sketches)
- Prototyping
- Evaluating

### 1.1.7 Usability Goals

- Effectiveness: how good at doing what it supposed to do
- Efficiency: how few steps needed
- Safety: how good at avoiding errors
- Utility: how appropriate are the functions user want to achieve
- Learnability: how quickly user can figure out what to do
- Memorability: how easy it sis to remember how to use

### 1.1.8 User Experience Goals

relate more to the relationship between user and product, rather than product it self. More subjective

- Desirable
  - Satisfying
  - Supporting
  - Provocative
  - ...
- Undesirable
  - Boring
  - Gimmicky
  - Annoying
  - ...
  
  ### 1.1.9 Design Principles
  
- Visibility
- Feedback
- Affordance
- \*Mapping
- Consistency
- Constraints
  
## 1.2 Process of ID
  
### 1.2.1 4 Approaches
  
- User-centered
  - Early focus on users and tasks
  - Empirical mrasurement
  - Iterative design
- Activity-centered
- Systems
- Genius

### 1.2.2 Practical Issues

#### 1.2.2.1 Users

many types
Stakeholders: People or organizations that will be affected by the system and have influence on the system requirements

#### 1.2.2.2 Needs

#### 1.2.2.3 Alternatives

#### 1.2.2.4 Choice

#### 1.2.2.5 Integration

### 1.2.3 Agile Manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
